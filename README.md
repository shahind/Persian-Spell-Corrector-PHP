# Persian-Spell-Corrector-PHP
this is a PHP Script which is developed based on Felipe Ribeiro's Work(http://www.feliperibeiro.com) who developed a Spell Checker for English based on Peter Norvig algorithm for PHP.

I just changed it in order to use it for Persian words.
a database of Persian words is used from Persian-Words-Database (https://github.com/shahind/Persian-Words-Database)
